# Punk is Natural

I think it would be great to plan ahead to avoid a societal crisis... Surging demand for food, of all things, is a really alarming sign. Same goes for shelter.

Any time a leader arises with a shred of empathy, it is turned into a culture war wedge issue and the crab bucket eats them alive. E.g. they showed support for X, which is the scorn of Y, and now they are persona non grata.

Any time a psychopath arises to lead, they are invincible to shame and accusations of favouritism - and the subsequent looting is breathtaking.

I believe the looting has lead to this crisis - and I think crisis is the only thing that acts as a check against psychopathy; a force greater than shame.

There are two kinds of crisis: the one created by the psychopath, which is reactionary and punishing of the disenfranchised, and the crisis created proactively, which is also punishing to the disenfranchised - but which creates franchise through solidarity.

The way forward has punk in its DNA. Can't be punk without being disenfranchised. Can't be punk without opposing abusive authority. Can't be punk unless you're willing to suffer for an ideal. And if you feel comfortable in this climate, then the very idea of punk is a threat.

If you're harassed by cops, afraid of your landlord, schedule shifted by the boss, getting wasted to escape for a minute ... you just might be punk without even realizing.

If you grew up with a dream and you watched the dream get looted into nothingness, you get it. If you grew up and your generation wasn't even promised anything, then you definitely get it. And if you get it, you just might think: fuck this.

And if you wake up one day to realize you've got more in common with other punks than not, then you can grant yourself the license to say: fuck this. If you're a punk, you can get off on making the right people uncomfortable. You can be good to other punks and show disrespect for those who don't deserve it.

I say: I am grateful to the people who make food banks work. And I have nothing but contempt for the monsters who make food banks necessary. Fuck this.
