# Parking is for Unused Cars

Parking lots are used to store personal vehicles while they are unused.

A car that isn't moving is just an obstruction to people who are doing useful things. A box full of useless things is a useless box; parking lots are the same.

We have gridlock traffic downtown because there are too many cars, most of which are inefficiently allocated as single-passenger vehicles.

There are not enough homes in Toronto, with supply lagging far behind the growth of Canada's economic engine - which has caused the cost of shelter to double in a decade.

Toronto cannot prioritize and protect parking lots any longer.
