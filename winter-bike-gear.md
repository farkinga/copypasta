# Winter Bike Gear

Do you ski? That's a great foundation for winter biking.

Consider the downhill helmet. Often, goggles integrate perfectly: there's a channel for the elastic strap, the goggles "dock" in the helmet so there are no air gaps, and the ears are protected without muffling hearing. Caveat: it's different from a bike helmet; make your own safety conclusions.

Gloves? Gripping ski poles is a lot like gripping handlebars.

Face protection? Just think about skiing. And if downhill isn't your thing, how do you -country ski? You still need face protective, gloves, leg mobility and wind protection.

The snow or rain? I paid for the lift ticket; I'm going to make the most of it.

Here's the last bit about skiing and biking: attitude. I believe some people who are willing to ski in terrible conditions would scoff at biking in the same conditions, not realizing it's very similar.

And something just about bikes: studded tires. They really work. The studs are usually removable so if you have to ride when there's no snow, and I'd you wear down the studs or they rust, you can replace them for the next season.

With this perspective, I'm pretty comfortable now riding in the winter.
