# The Bushes were Friends with the Saudis

There's two kinds of conspiracy theorists here:

- the "jet fuel/steel beams" sort
- the "Bush was friends with the Saudis" sort

For the first kind, there's basically no reasoning with them. None of it can be falsified, there are tons of "coincidences" and so on.

For the second kind, which I considered myself among (previously):

- George W Bush really was friends with the guy who funded 9/11: [Prince Bandar "Bush."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_bin_Sultan_Al_Saud)
- Bandar really did meet Bush at the White House on 9/13. 
- Special arrangements really were made for several prominent Saudi families, including the Bin Ladens, to flee the United States despite restricted air travel.
- 9/11 was used as part of the US justification for attacking Iraq - an enemy of Saudi Arabia - when in fact the 9/11 attack was funded and conducted BY Saudi Arabians.
- There really was a "cover-up" known as [The 28 Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_28_pages) that were redacted from the 9/11 commission report

And now that the 28 pages have been published, I think the real story goes like this:

- Bandar did not plan 9/11; his accounts were used without his knowledge
- it was embarrassing for Bandar's assets to have been used to fund the attacks
- it created a problem for Bush because they were in fact friendly and it looked really bad
- Bush ultimately used his executive authority to redact the 28 pages of the commission report that described Bandar's visit to the White House, the use of his accounts, etc...

In my mind, there are two possible worlds that fit the facts - and one of these worlds is more likely than the other:

1. either Bush and the Saudis orchestrated 9/11 as a precursor to invading Iraq
2. or Bush and Bandar were made to look foolish, embarrassed by their entourages' abuse of the diplomatic grace offered to them.

I don't think #1 happened; if it had, there would have been a lot more facts to support it. Yes, the Bush administration did knowingly connect Saddam Hussein to 9/11 despite there being no link, and this was used as part of the popular justification for invading Iraq. Those were lies and that was one clear way to use 9/11 to advance the Bush administration agenda. So it seemed like they benefited; hence the conspiracy theory they were "in on it." But in reality, it doesn't require Bush or his administration to have literally planned 9/11.

I do think #2 happened - it was embarrassing and potentially a serious threat to how the public perceived the friendship between the Bushes and the Saudis - and that is, to me, a satisfying explanation for the 28 pages.  In other words, the cover-up was real - but they were covering up their shame and incompetence.
