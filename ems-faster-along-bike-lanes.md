# EMS is Faster with Bike Lanes

Toronto examined TPS response times already when evaluating the ActiveTO project.

The study found that traffic got worse throughout the entire city between 2019 and 2022. However, TPS response times in ActiveTO pilot areas were 36 seconds faster than the rest of the city.

    Response times within the ActiveTO pilot area increased by 36 seconds less than the increase experienced on a city-wide basis in 2022, compared to the same time period in 2019 (pre-pandemic).

So, if you're noticing that traffic is getting worse, that's probably true - but what you're missing is that the streets with bike lanes are still faster for emergency response.
