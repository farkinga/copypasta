# Drivers hate driving

Ask any Toronto driver:

- Do you like driving on the Gardiner, Lakeshore, the DVP, or the 401?
- Do you think other Toronto drivers are skilled or inept?
- Do you think other Toronto drivers are friendly or assholes?
- Do you like your commute?
- Do you think traffic levels are comfortable?
- Do you think car insurance rates are reasonable?
