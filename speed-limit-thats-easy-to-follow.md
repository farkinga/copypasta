# A Speed Limit that's Easy to Follow

Installing bike lanes can be an effective method to lower speeds if done in a principled way. The principle has to do with narrowing roads from 401-series width to something that "feels" tight for a passenger vehicle.

The feeling of narrower roads is so effective because it is automatic for drivers to change their behaviors, unlike interventions such as written signs that actually require more attention from drivers.

People WILL drive slower when the lanes are narrow for the same reason people WILL speed in Parkside. The drivers themselves will explain it to you:

- the wide lanes make them want to go fast
- they don't notice their speed
- the speed cameras and signs distract them

It works exactly the same in reverse. Drivers will not even notice they are driving slower; they simply will and anyone who's ever driven understands exactly how it works.

There are many techniques for traffic calming - and narrowing the lanes is a good one. There are many ways to narrow the lanes - and adding bike lanes is one way to accomplish that.
