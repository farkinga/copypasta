# Key facts about heat pumps

- 4-season operation: generate heat in winter and cold in summer
- underground coil systems are old tech; much better options exist now
- new "mini-split" system
  - a 2ft x 2ft x 1ft box bolts to outside wall
  - 3ft x 0.5ft blower attaches indoors by ceiling
  - price range 1000-3000 USD
  - advanced DIY project or hire professional
- the tech has improved massively in the last 5 years
- beyond the tipping point; actually the cheapest option
  - makes economic sense; death blow to expensive alternatives like gas
- "cold climate" systems can operate down to -20 C
- at mild temperatures, up to 400% efficient (see definition below)
- they can completely replace gas or oil systems while costing less
  - (gas and oil are below 100% efficiency)
- they can completely replace central cooling + blower fan, ducts
- **heat pumps pose an existential threat to residential gas utility**
  - "tipping the scale"; even capitalism cannot save fossil fuels

Efficiency means: if 1 unit of energy input creates 1 unit of heat output, then that is 100% efficient.  If 1 unit of input creates 4 units output, it is over 100% efficiency.
