title:      Unaffordable Babies

I'm seeing a bunch of comments about having a baby without being able to "afford" it.

This comment comes up so often and I could never quite identify what I disliked so much about it - until recently.

Most people are paid for the time they work - so their time and work become equated with the amount paid. Since it costs money to acquire the basic necessities to live, in order to live you must acquire money. Altogether, time/work is exchanged for money, which is used to stay alive (food/shelter).

Using that framework, how to make sense of a person who does not work? The math doesn't add up; it's easy to see the negative balance. The only way to make it add up is when one person works extra, or gets more money, to pay for the non-productive person. This happens all the time, like when a family member is injured and needs care.

There is an even more frequent case of a person who does not work: babies. It will be many years before anyone would pay to buy their time - and even worse, they actually cost money for many years! A baby is expensive and it will destroy the equation that balances the cost of living necessities vs the amount one's labour is worth.

In this framework, the only way to have a baby while earning the necessities for life is to earn more than is required for one person to live. If you're only paying for your own necessities, how will you pay that plus the baby necessities? The math does not add up if you're just getting by.

There's no baby earning enough to keep itself alive - so there's no baby that can live except by depending on someone who can earn enough. So who can earn enough? Only those who earn more than one person requires to live.

Minimum wage is thought of as the amount required for the necessities of life - for one person. If you are going to pay for more than one person, as is the case with a baby, you'll need to earn more than minimum wage. This is the problem.

By this reasoning, no person earning minimum wage can afford a child. It's just the math of it. The horrifying implication of this argument amounts to class-based eugenics, in which the vast majority of the population do not have license to procreate - and if they do, they receive scorn and condemnation. That brings us back to the above comment, which pointed out the math (and how it doesn't add up).

If we said "only the wealthy may have children" it sounds pretty bad and the people who believe that would argue it's an oversimplification of their viewpoint. Except it's not an oversimplification. If there's an income threshold below which someone cannot "afford" to have a baby, then only some people CAN afford to have a baby. This is a eugenics framework based on economic class.
