# Shame Made the Patriot Act

Bin Laden had beef with the Saudi royal family; they weren't fundamentalist enough, on average. He had beef with the Bushes. 9/11 touched on both.

Prince Bandar was personal friends with W Bush. Bandar's accounts were used to fund the 9/11 attacks. This was a "fuck you" from bin Laden to both Bandar and to Bush.

After the 9/11 attacks, on Sept 13, Bandar was summoned to the white house, after which several Saudi families left the US - including the bin Ladens.

I believe Bandar did not immediately know his bank account had been used to funnel money into the US to fund the attack. However, it seems clear to me that between Bush and Bandar, by Sept 13 it was already partly-understood what had happened on 9/11.

Soooo ... bin Laden was probably dedicated to attacking the World Trade Center; he had done so in 1993, too. But had Bush not been in power, and had the Saudis not been so closely aligned with US foreign policy, would 9/11 have happened? Impossible to say - but the fact it happened with Bush in power does mean the attack was at least partially "personal."
