We've constructed a substantial economy around cars, their fuel, and their infrastructure. Like, a REALLY big economy. And it's fundamentally bankrupt; it doesn't stand on its own merits. The only way to make it work is at scale - and that requires massive overhead, like regulations, actual warfare to acquire resources, and propaganda like we've never seen. For example, Big Oil spent DECADES paying scientists to argue climate change wasn't partly attributable to fossil fuels.

And it all makes sense, when you zoom out. Is it possible there are a billion jobs, globally, that hinge on this massive project? From the mining and drilling to shipping and refining to road construction to car manufacture to advertising and sales to the loans and insurance to the taxi driver, there are a lot of jobs between ... For many, a car loan is their gateway to the credit system. In a system of money Legos, cars play an outsized role.

I think the prospect of disrupting that global economy is terrifying to policymakers. It has similar dimensions as real estate and credit swaps: when it crashes, it will be catastrophic. And, running it turbo as we have, we've found there is an economic quadrant where the whole system can generate value - or at least, extract value.

Writ large, we've collectively conjured a golem, in the biblical sense. This is a monster that marches of its own accord; no single human made it, no single human can stop it. The momentum - the mass and force - strongly resists any shift.

As they say, you can't convince someone otherwise when their job depends on it. I think the industry is truly bankrupt and if it's not actively "propped up," it will collapse. But many people work tirelessly to keep it rolling - and altogether, they represent a powerful counter-argument for car-centric maximalism.
