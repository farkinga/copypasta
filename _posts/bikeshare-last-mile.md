# Bikeshare Solves the Last Mile Problem

Since bikeshare solves an important problem in Toronto, it is worthy of consideration for some sort of public budget.

Here's a few things that I think are true:

- there is proven demand for bikeshare in Toronto
- the bikeshare system is stressed by the current level of usage
- bikeshare is under-funded and could not handle higher use
- increased bikeshare funding would enable the system to meet a growing demand
- cities use annual budgets to allocate funds for solutions to the problems faced by its residents
- the city seeks to provide transit options for its residents
- bikeshare, which is already popular, solves a major transit problem for city residents
- bikeshare already receives some public support, in addition to user fees
- if we provided more funding to bikeshare, they are already set up to receive it and work with it
