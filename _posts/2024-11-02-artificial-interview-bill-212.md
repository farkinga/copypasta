## How is the removal of bike lanes from key arterial streets likely to impact travel times along those streets and throughout the city?

The removal of bike lanes from key arterial streets is likely to impact travel times along those streets and throughout the city by potentially increasing congestion, reducing safety, and discouraging cycling. Here's how this change could impact travel times:

1. **Increased Congestion**:
    - Removing bike lanes reduces the available road space for vehicles, potentially increasing congestion along arterial streets.
    - As traffic backing up on arterial streets spills onto feeder and collector streets, this could lead to increased congestion throughout the city.
    - Studies have shown that removing bike lanes can increase vehicular traffic by as much as 17% on a street, which can lead to significant increases in travel time for both drivers and cyclists.
2. **Reduced Safety**:
    - Removing bike lanes forces cyclists to share space with vehicles, potentially increasing the risk of accidents between vehicles and bicycles.
    - The absence of dedicated bike lanes may also encourage cyclists to ride on the sidewalk, further increasing the risk of accidents with pedestrians.
    - As a result of reduced safety, some cyclists may choose to avoid arterial streets altogether, which could lead to longer travel times for both drivers and cyclists.
3. **Discouraging Cycling**:
    - Removing bike lanes sends a message to cyclists that their safety and mobility are not prioritized, potentially discouraging cycling in the city.
    - This could lead to a decrease in cycling trips, as cyclists may choose to drive instead or avoid certain arterial streets altogether.
    - As a result, there could be an increase in vehicle traffic and congestion along arterial streets.
4. **Impact on Feeder and Collector Streets**:
    - As traffic backs up on arterial streets due to the removal of bike lanes, feeder and collector streets may also experience increased congestion.
    - This could lead to longer travel times for drivers and cyclists using feeder and collector streets to access arterial streets.
5. **Economic Impacts**:
    - Increased congestion on arterial streets due to the removal of bike lanes could lead to reduced productivity, increased fuel consumption, and higher operating costs for businesses and commuters.
    - The removal of bike lanes could also discourage cycling, which may have economic impacts on businesses that cater to cyclists.

Overall, the removal of bike lanes from key arterial streets is likely to have negative impacts on travel times along those streets and throughout the city by increasing congestion, reducing safety, discouraging cycling, and potentially leading to economic costs. To minimize these impacts, it is essential to maintain or improve cycling infrastructure on arterial streets and prioritize the safety and mobility of cyclists in urban transportation planning.
## How would bill 212 justify the removal of bike lanes?

Bill 212, as drafted and currently under consideration, does not explicitly justify the removal of bike lanes on key arterial streets. In fact, the bill does not mention anything about removing bike lanes or affecting cycling infrastructure in any significant way.

However, one could argue that the bill's focus on expediting highway construction projects and reducing gridlock might indirectly imply prioritizing vehicular traffic over other modes of transportation, including cycling. The bill aims to streamline processes and increase efficiency in highway construction projects by limiting public involvement, reducing consultation requirements, and providing ministerial discretion to override certain laws and regulations.

Critics might interpret this emphasis on vehicular traffic and highway construction as indirectly supporting the removal of bike lanes, as it could facilitate more space for vehicles on arterial streets. However, this interpretation is not explicitly stated or implied in the current version of Bill 212.

To better understand whether and how Bill 212 might justify the removal of bike lanes, it would be essential to review any future amendments or changes to the bill and consider public sentiment on cycling infrastructure in Ontario. As it stands, the current version of Bill 212 does not provide a strong justification for removing bike lanes on key arterial streets.
## Altogether, does Bill 212 propose the best use of Ontario's budget for the purpose of "Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time"?

Based on an analysis of Bill 212's provisions and their potential impacts, it is not clear that the bill proposes the best use of Ontario's budget for the purpose of "Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time." While the legislation aims to expedite highway construction projects and reduce gridlock through various measures, it faces criticisms and potential shortcomings that could limit its overall effectiveness and efficiency in tackling traffic congestion.

Here are some reasons why Bill 212 might not be the best use of Ontario's budget for reducing gridlock and saving commuting time:

1. **Limited Focus on Multimodal Transportation**: Bill 212 primarily focuses on expediting highway construction projects and reducing gridlock by addressing vehicular traffic issues. However, it does not place sufficient emphasis on encouraging and accommodating other modes of transportation, such as cycling and public transportation, which could also significantly contribute to reducing congestion and saving commuting time.
2. **Potential Environmental Impacts**: The bill's emphasis on highway construction projects could lead to negative environmental impacts, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions due to higher fuel consumption resulting from congestion and potential reductions in cycling infrastructure. Addressing these environmental concerns is crucial for creating a sustainable transportation system that saves commuting time in the long run.
3. **Limited Public Involvement**: Bill 212 aims to streamline processes and increase efficiency in highway construction projects by reducing public involvement, consultation requirements, and ministerial discretion to override certain laws and regulations. However, this approach might limit opportunities for public input and could result in projects that do not fully address local needs or preferences.
4. **Potential Economic Costs**: The legislation could lead to increased costs for businesses and commuters due to reduced productivity, higher fuel consumption, and operating costs resulting from congestion. Addressing these economic implications is essential for creating a transportation system that saves commuting time and supports overall productivity.
5. **Limited Focus on Long-term Solutions**: Bill 212 primarily targets short-term solutions for reducing gridlock, such as expediting highway construction projects. However, a more comprehensive and effective approach to reducing gridlock would also prioritize long-term solutions, such as investing in public transportation infrastructure and demand management strategies.

In summary, while Bill 212 aims to reduce gridlock and save commuting time through various measures, its focus on vehicular traffic, limited emphasis on multimodal transportation, potential environmental impacts, limited public involvement, and limited focus on long-term solutions might limit its overall effectiveness and efficiency in tackling traffic congestion. To create a more comprehensive and effective transportation system that reduces gridlock, saves commuting time, and supports sustainability and economic productivity, a more balanced approach that addresses the needs of all road users, the environment, and the long-term is essential.
