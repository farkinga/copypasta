# THe Network Properties of Transit

The "value" of networks relates to the number of nodes SQUARED.

Adding just 1 station to a transit brings more people in - and immediately every other station gains a new destination.

If you've got 50 stations and you add 1:

- that's 1 station with 50 new exits
- and 50 stations with 1 new exit.

By Metcalfe's law, the value was 50^2=2500 and now it is 51^2=2601. Adding 1 station caused the value to jump by 101. Add one more and you've got 52^2=2704, which is a gain of 103.

In other words, each new transit station delivers more value, exponentially, which actually REDUCES the utility cost for every subsequent station.

This is the opposite growth function we see for traffic, in which adding one lane actually increases demand:

This means road networks are GUARANTEED to seize up from congestion, eventually, as they grow. Adding a lane makes the car system less efficient, not more. It is IMPOSSIBLE to reduce congestion by expanding the automobile network.

All this to say: yes, adding bike lanes is SO COST EFFECTIVE. The surface already exists and the psychopath Toronto method of painting the lane means it costs less than 100k per kilometre.

Yes, yes, yes: bike lanes are the perfect pairing for a rapid transit expansion.
